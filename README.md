# Page Transition Demo

This project showcases multiple HTML pages, each demonstrating a different transition idea. You can open any of the pages to explore how various animations work when navigating between screens.

Although native page-to-page transitions are limited, this project uses simple JavaScript and CSS tricks to create smooth effects such as fade-out, slide-out, and other animations before navigating to the next page.

## How It Works
- **Each HTML file contains its own design and transition concept**
- **The index page acts as the starting point and allows you to choose any transition demo**
- **Pages use basic JavaScript to animate the current page before redirecting to another HTML file**
- **CSS handles the visual animation (fade, slide, etc.)**
- **After the animation completes, the script loads the next page using `<a href>` tag**
